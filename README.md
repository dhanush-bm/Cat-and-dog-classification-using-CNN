# Cat-and-dog-classification-using-CNN
The main goal of this project is to develop a system that can identify images of cats and dogs. The input image will be analyzed and then the output is predicted
Skills used: Python, Keras, Tensorflow

Project Objective: Prediction of whether a given image is a Cat or a Dog using Convolutional Neural Networks which may be further implemented as a feature in a bigger project.

Quantifiable result: We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of 80% using 23 epochs.

  *Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
  *Training model on basis of given data
  *Fitting the CNN to see if the provided image is dog or cat
