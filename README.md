# Cat-and-dog-classification-using-CNN

Skills used: Python, Keras, Tensorflow

Project Objective: Prediction of whether a given image is a Cat or a Dog using Convolutional Neural Networks which may be further implemented as a feature in a bigger project.

Quantifiable result: We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of 80% using 25 epochs.

  *Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
  
  *Training model on basis of given data
  
  *Fitting the CNN to see if the provided image is dog or cat
